# ðŸ•’ MTE 241 Lab: Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Project

---

## ðŸ“˜ Lab Overview

In this lab, students design and implement a simplified Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) in C. The primary goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of real-time systems by developing a kernel that manages multiple concurrent processes with deterministic behavior.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Process Management:** Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Interprocess Communication (IPC):** Mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize their actions.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Responding to asynchronous events using simulated hardware interrupts.
- **Scheduling Algorithms:** Implementing priority-based scheduling to manage process execution order.
- **Context Switching:** Saving and restoring process states to allow multitasking.
